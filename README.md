# ðŸ“Š Employee Turnover Analysis

This project explores employee turnover using a real-world HR dataset. It investigates what organizational and behavioral factors contribute to employee attrition, providing both statistical insights and predictive modeling.

## ðŸ§  Objective
Identify trends and variables that are correlated with employee turnover and simulate how improving those factors could reduce attrition.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- CSV exports for Power BI visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- The Sales and HR departments have the highest turnover rates.
- Lower salary levels are highly associated with employee departure.
- Satisfaction level is one of the most important predictors of attrition.
- Tenure beyond 4 years also shows higher rates of turnover.

## ðŸ¤– Predictive Modeling
A Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict whether an employee will leave, based on satisfaction, evaluation score, number of projects, and more.

### Visualizations Included:
- Turnover rate by department and salary
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature importance chart
- Confusion matrix

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Download this notebook and dataset.
2. Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the full analysis.
